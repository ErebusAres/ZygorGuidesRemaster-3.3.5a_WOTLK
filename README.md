# Zygor Guides Viewer Remaster (3.3.5a WotLK)

This is a remastered UI/UX fork of Zygor Guides Viewer for **World of Warcraft 3.3.5a (build 12340)**, intended for private servers (e.g., TrinityCore). It is intended to **replace the original Zygor Guides Viewer addon** for 3.3.5a.

## What's New

- **Remastered UI** (default) with modernized layout and styling.
- **Legacy UI still available** for those who want the original look.
- Guide content is preserved and expanded where applicable (e.g., additional imported guides).
- Functional behavior preserved: step progression, waypoints, parsing, etc.
- New remaster skins including **Goals** theme.

## Installation

1. Exit World of Warcraft completely.
2. Open your AddOns folder:
   - `%WoWFolder%\Interface\AddOns\`
3. Remove any existing Zygor folders:
   - Delete `ZygorGuidesViewer`
   - Delete `ZygorTalentAdvisor`; Optionally, if you plan to reinstall ZygorTalentAdvisor.
4. Download or clone this repository.
5. Copy the folder **`ZygorGuidesViewerRM`**, Optionally: **`ZygorTalentAdvisor`** into your AddOns directory:
   - `%WoWFolder%\Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM`
   - `%WoWFolder%\Interface\Addons\ZygorTalentAdvisor`
6. Start the game and enable:
   - **Zygor Guides Viewer Remastered**
   - **Zygor Talent Advisor** (optional)

## Notes

- This project is designed for **WotLK 3.3.5a (build 12340)**.
- This remaster focuses on UI/UX and guide organization for 3.3.5a; core logic is preserved.
- `ZygorTalentAdvisor` is included for convenience. It has not been modified and is provided only to consolidate the addon package.

## Known Issues

- Some imported guides may be incomplete or require content beyond 3.3.5a; if a guide behaves oddly, disable it in `Guides/Autoload.xml` and report the issue.
- This remaster targets 3.3.5a (build 12340) only. Newer expansion data is intentionally excluded.

## Credits

All credit for the original Zygor Guides concept and content belongs to the original creators. This remaster focuses on UI/UX modernization and packaging for 3.3.5a private server use.
