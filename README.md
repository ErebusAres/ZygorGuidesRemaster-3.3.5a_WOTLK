# Zygor Guides Viewer Remaster (3.3.5a WotLK)

This is a remastered UI/UX fork of Zygor Guides Viewer for **World of Warcraft 3.3.5a (build 12340)**, intended for private servers (e.g., TrinityCore).

## What’s New
- **Remastered UI** (default) with modernized layout and styling.
- **Legacy UI still available** for those who want the original look.
- Guide content remains **unchanged** (byte-for-byte from the source).
- Functional behavior preserved: step progression, waypoints, parsing, etc.
- New remaster skins including **Goals** theme.

## Installation
1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Copy the folder **`ZygorGuidesViewerRM`** into your WoW AddOns directory:
   - `%WoWFolder%\Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM`
3. Start the game and enable **Zygor Guides Viewer Remastered** in the AddOns list.

## Notes
- This project is designed for **WotLK 3.3.5a (build 12340)**.
- This remaster focuses on UI/UX only; guides and core logic are preserved.
- The old `ZygorTalentAdvisor` folder is not required for the remaster.

## Credits
All credit for the original Zygor Guides concept and content belongs to the original creators. This remaster focuses on UI/UX modernization and packaging for 3.3.5a private server use.
