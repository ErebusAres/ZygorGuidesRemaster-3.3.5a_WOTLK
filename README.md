## Version

- Version: ![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/t/ErebusAres/ZygorGuidesRemaster-3.3.5a_WOTLK?label=Version%203.0.&color=1f6feb)
- Intended client: **WotLK 3.3.5a / 12340**

## Who This Is For

This addon is intended for:

- World of Warcraft **WotLK 3.3.5a (build 12340)** clients
- Private server environments (for example TrinityCore-based servers)
- Players who want the classic Zygor guide experience with a cleaner UI

This project is primarily focused on **WotLK 3.3.5a**. Other clients may work, but support and testing are centered on 3.3.5a.

## What You Get

- Step-by-step leveling and quest progression guidance.
- Arrow and waypoint navigation while you play.
- Structured objective flow (accept, complete, and turn-in).
- A cleaner, more readable viewer UI designed for long play sessions.
- Includes talent guidance via the bundled `ZygorTalentAdvisor` module inside `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`.

## What Stayed the Same

Core 3.3.5a-era behavior is preserved:

- Guide parser and step engine.
- Map and waypoint workflow.
- Legacy guide execution patterns.
- Base `ZygorTalentAdvisor` behavior and structure.

## What's New in the Remaster

- Cleaner, retail-inspired UI shell for both guide browsing and options.
- New standalone Guide Manager (Home / Featured / Current / Recent) with category sidebar, search, favorites, and folder-style tree behavior.
- New in-app Options experience with categorized navigation, searchable pages, and improved layout consistency.
- Remastered waypoint arrow and objective text styling updates, including clearer action/title/distance presentation and distance color gradients.
- Accessibility improvements including colorblind presets and simplified noun-color handling for better readability.
- Ongoing compatibility focus for 3.3.5a environments and expanded guide coverage where applicable.

## Included Components

1. `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` - Remastered viewer and guide runtime.
2. `ZygorTalentAdvisor` - bundled inside `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` and loaded as part of the addon package.

## Key Controls

- Minimap icon:
  - Left-click toggles the guide viewer.
  - Right-click opens the Guide Manager.
  - Shift + Right-click opens options.
- Viewer toolbar:
  - Guides left-click opens the legacy quick guide dropdown.
  - Guides right-click opens the Guide Manager.
  - Settings left-click opens quick settings.
  - Settings right-click opens Guide Manager options.
- Gear Advisor role shortcuts:
  - `/zygortank` or `/ztank` selects the class's tank profile for the active talent group.
  - `/zygordps` or `/zdps` selects a matching damage profile.
  - `/zygorheal` or `/zheal` selects a healing profile; `/zygorsupport`, `/zsupport`, `/zygorsup`, and `/zsup` use the same healing-role profile because WotLK has no separate support stat set.
  - `/zygorrole auto` or `/zrole auto` returns only the active talent group to automatic talent-tree detection.

## Quick Install

### Installation Overview

1. Download the ZIP.
2. Extract to `Interface\AddOns\`.
3. Launch the game.
4. Enable the addon.

### Detailed Steps

1. Close World of Warcraft.
2. Open `%WoWFolder%\Interface\AddOns\`.
3. Remove older folders if present:
   - `ZygorGuidesViewer`
   - `ZygorTalentAdvisor`
   - This avoids mixed files from older releases.
4. Copy this folder into `AddOns`:
   - `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`
5. Confirm the top-level folder exists:
   - `Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM\ZygorGuidesViewerRM.toc`
6. Launch the game and enable the addon.

## Common Issues

**Addon not showing in-game**

- Make sure the folder structure is:
  - `Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM\ZygorGuidesViewerRM.toc`
- Do not nest folders (no double folder level).

**Out of date warning**

- Enable **Load out of date AddOns** on the character select screen.

**Guide not progressing**

- Some imported guides may not fully match 3.3.5a data.
- See the Known Issues section below.

## Update Notes

1. Install or update the `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` folder as a single addon package.
2. `/reload` is usually enough for Lua-only changes.
3. A full relaunch is safer when files, XML includes, assets, or bundled modules change.

## Guide Profiles

- Current default guide content is the remastered, TrinityCore-oriented profile for WotLK 3.3.5a private servers.
- An optional Alliance fallback profile exists at `Guides\Leveling_Original\ZygorGuidesAlliance.lua`.
- That fallback is original, unmodified classic Zygor content and should only be used if the remastered default route is problematic for a specific session.

## Localization

Localization key coverage is complete across shipped locales (`Main` + `NPCs`) with placeholder and format-consistency checks.

Current focus is community QA review:

- natural phrasing in live gameplay context,
- terminology consistency,
- official localized NPC proper names,
- encoding and readability verification.

Localization was largely AI-assisted and should be treated as needing community review until native-speaker QA confirms quality.

## Changelog

### Revision 236 - 3.0.236

- Fixed the 3.0.235 dead-on-login startup regression that could create a corpse marker before the pointer overlay existed, producing repeated `OverlayFrame` nil errors.
- Deferred only the premature marker attempt; the normal post-startup waypoint selection and corpse retry create the arrow once all pointer frames are ready.
- Reduced the confirmed guide submenu hover-intent delay from 0.15 to 0.075 seconds for faster category navigation.

### Revision 235 - 3.0.235

- Fixed corpse-arrow startup on clients that return valid corpse coordinates while the current map zone is still `0`; the addon now resolves the actual corpse zone before creating the waypoint.
- Made the main Zygor category and subcategories initialize when Blizzard Interface Options is opened, retaining deferred startup while keeping the classic settings path available after every login.
- Removed a redundant hidden-frame options render/release cycle when opening the remastered Guide Manager, reducing unnecessary old-client UI work without disabling the remastered options.
- Made third-level and deeper guide submenus continue in their established cascade direction while room remains, preventing them from folding back over earlier menus.

### Revision 234 - 3.0.234

- Restored the classic Blizzard Interface Options fallback by creating the addon's deferred option panels before opening them. This keeps the main Zygor category and its subcategories available instead of falling through to the separately registered Talent Advisor panel.
- Improved legacy guide-menu placement near screen edges. Nested menus now open on the side with enough room instead of screen clamping them over the parent menu.
- Added focused regression coverage for both classic options entry points and left/right submenu placement.

### Revision 233 - 3.0.233

- Refreshed hidden map context before corpse lookup so logging in or reloading while already dead can recover from a map left on the selected guide's zone; delayed coordinates retain the existing retry behavior.
- Replaced randomized joke text with a clear localized corpse label by default. Added an opt-in **Use humorous corpse-arrow messages** setting for the five legacy messages.
- Added focused coverage for startup map refresh, the clear default label, and the legacy-message preference.

### Revision 232 - 3.0.232

- Fixed corpse waypoints displaying the active guide destination as their title even when the corpse arrow itself pointed to the correct location.
- Adjusted the guide picker hover-intent delay from 0.4 to 0.15 seconds based on confirmed in-game feedback, retaining accidental-hover protection without feeling sluggish.

### Revision 231 - 3.0.231

- Added proper support for guide-coordinate distance comparators such as `|goto 60.18,68.79 > 50`, based on Tntdruid's parser report.
- Preserved the comparator direction so departure steps complete only after moving farther than the requested distance, while existing `<` arrival steps retain their current behavior.
- Added regression coverage for both comparator directions and the affected Razaan's Landing flight step.

## Notes

- Intended target client is **WotLK 3.3.5a (12340)**.
- It may work on other versions, but compatibility is not guaranteed.
- `ZygorTalentAdvisor` is bundled and loaded from within `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`.

## Known Issues

- Arrow scale/position drift:
  - On some setups, changing Waypoint Arrow Scale can shift the arrow position unexpectedly.
  - Resetting arrow position may not fully normalize the anchor in all UI/minimap addon combinations.
  - Status: deferred for now.

- Some imported guides may be incomplete or not fully aligned to 3.3.5a data.
- If a guide behaves incorrectly, disable it in `ZygorGuidesViewerRM/Guides/Autoload.xml` and report it.
