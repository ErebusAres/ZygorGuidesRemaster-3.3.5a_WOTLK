## Version

- Version: ![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/t/ErebusAres/ZygorGuidesRemaster-3.3.5a_WOTLK?label=Version%203.0.&color=1f6feb)
- Intended client: **WotLK 3.3.5a / 12340**

## Who This Is For

This addon is intended for:

- World of Warcraft **WotLK 3.3.5a (build 12340)** clients
- Private server environments (for example TrinityCore-based servers)
- Players who want the classic Zygor guide experience with a cleaner UI

This project is primarily focused on **WotLK 3.3.5a**. Other clients may work, but support and testing are centered on 3.3.5a.

## What You Get

- Step-by-step leveling and quest progression guidance.
- Arrow and waypoint navigation while you play.
- Structured objective flow (accept, complete, and turn-in).
- A cleaner, more readable viewer UI designed for long play sessions.
- Includes talent guidance via the bundled `ZygorTalentAdvisor` module inside `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`.

## What Stayed the Same

Core 3.3.5a-era behavior is preserved:

- Guide parser and step engine.
- Map and waypoint workflow.
- Legacy guide execution patterns.
- Base `ZygorTalentAdvisor` behavior and structure.

## What's New in the Remaster

- Cleaner, retail-inspired UI shell for both guide browsing and options.
- New standalone Guide Manager (Home / Featured / Current / Recent) with category sidebar, search, favorites, and folder-style tree behavior.
- New in-app Options experience with categorized navigation, searchable pages, and improved layout consistency.
- Remastered waypoint arrow and objective text styling updates, including clearer action/title/distance presentation and distance color gradients.
- Accessibility improvements including colorblind presets and simplified noun-color handling for better readability.
- Ongoing compatibility focus for 3.3.5a environments and expanded guide coverage where applicable.

## Included Components

1. `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` - Remastered viewer and guide runtime.
2. `ZygorTalentAdvisor` - bundled inside `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` and loaded as part of the addon package.

## Key Controls

- Minimap icon:
  - Left-click toggles the guide viewer.
  - Right-click opens the Guide Manager.
  - Shift + Right-click opens options.
- Viewer toolbar:
  - Guides left-click opens the legacy quick guide dropdown.
  - Guides right-click opens the Guide Manager.
  - Settings left-click opens quick settings.
  - Settings right-click opens Guide Manager options.

## Quick Install

### Installation Overview

1. Download the ZIP.
2. Extract to `Interface\AddOns\`.
3. Launch the game.
4. Enable the addon.

### Detailed Steps

1. Close World of Warcraft.
2. Open `%WoWFolder%\Interface\AddOns\`.
3. Remove older folders if present:
   - `ZygorGuidesViewer`
   - `ZygorTalentAdvisor`
   - This avoids mixed files from older releases.
4. Copy this folder into `AddOns`:
   - `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`
5. Confirm the top-level folder exists:
   - `Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM\ZygorGuidesViewerRM.toc`
6. Launch the game and enable the addon.

## Common Issues

**Addon not showing in-game**

- Make sure the folder structure is:
  - `Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM\ZygorGuidesViewerRM.toc`
- Do not nest folders (no double folder level).

**Out of date warning**

- Enable **Load out of date AddOns** on the character select screen.

**Guide not progressing**

- Some imported guides may not fully match 3.3.5a data.
- See the Known Issues section below.

## Update Notes

1. Install or update the `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` folder as a single addon package.
2. `/reload` is usually enough for Lua-only changes.
3. A full relaunch is safer when files, XML includes, assets, or bundled modules change.

## Guide Profiles

- Current default guide content is the remastered, TrinityCore-oriented profile for WotLK 3.3.5a private servers.
- An optional Alliance fallback profile exists at `Guides\Leveling_Original\ZygorGuidesAlliance.lua`.
- That fallback is original, unmodified classic Zygor content and should only be used if the remastered default route is problematic for a specific session.

## Localization

Localization key coverage is complete across shipped locales (`Main` + `NPCs`) with placeholder and format-consistency checks.

Current focus is community QA review:

- natural phrasing in live gameplay context,
- terminology consistency,
- official localized NPC proper names,
- encoding and readability verification.

Localization was largely AI-assisted and should be treated as needing community review until native-speaker QA confirms quality.

### Community Credits

- [`mikki33`](https://github.com/mikki33) for providing Russian localization changes and review updates.

## Support Wanted (Localization QA)

If you can validate translations in-game, your help is very welcome.

Please report:

- mistranslations,
- awkward phrasing,
- broken placeholders (`%s`, `%d`, `|n`, color codes),
- incorrect NPC names,
- encoding artifacts.

## Safety and Trust

## Changelog

### Revision 212 - 3.0.212

- Wrapped legacy quick-guide pagination ranges in brackets so structural submenu entries are visually distinct from guide level ranges.
- Kept the labels locale-neutral without adding untranslated UI text.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.212.

### Revision 211 - 3.0.211

- Fixed zhCN startup failing because the locale loaded before the main viewer object existed, and hardened the same initialization path for koKR and zhTW.
- Paginated oversized legacy quick-guide folders into groups of 25 so every guide remains reachable on smaller displays or larger UI scales.
- Kept native cascading guide menus and custom settings dropdowns clamped to the screen, including submenu frames created on demand.
- Reviewed and adapted the initial guide-menu patch supplied by @Polypheides in issue #92.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.211.

### Revision 210 - 3.0.210

- Fixed the route-calculation budget option calling LibRover without the required active profile, which caused a nil-profile error when changing the dropdown.
- Made the dropdown check indicators use a bundled addon texture instead of depending on a stock UI texture that can be absent from GlueXML-modified clients.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.210.

### Revision 209 - 3.0.209

- Changed fallback armor scoring so it remains useful for early statless equipment but cannot outweigh an item's other attributes; tank profiles that explicitly value armor are unchanged.
- Expanded the extreme armor-downgrade safeguard to reject candidates more than 40 item levels below uncommon-or-better equipped gear, covering the level-72 Elemental Shaman example reported in issue #79.
- Prioritized the corpse waypoint while the player is dead, including clearing external quest arrows when the death event fires and preventing later guide updates from replacing the corpse arrow.
- Cleaned up confirmed invalid or obsolete XML, texture, font, binding-header, and TOC declarations reported in issue #89 while preserving optional custom guide and talent-build slots.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.209.

### Revision 208 - 3.0.208

- Added a class-wide Wrath 3.3.5a weapon proficiency matrix so Gear Advisor consistently rejects weapons the current class cannot equip, including swords on Druids and shields on Death Knights.
- Added the missing Wrath weapon proficiencies for Druid polearms and Rogue one-handed axes across their Gear Advisor builds.
- Kept spec-specific weapon preferences layered beneath the class proficiency guard so scoring cannot override hard class restrictions.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.208.

### Revision 207 - 3.0.207

- Added HD/WDM map compatibility for 53 phased starting-area, cave, mine, and dungeon-entrance map identifiers used by common 3.3.5a map patches.
- Added localized subzone lookups for guide conditions and diagnostic reports while preserving the addon's existing zone library and stock-client behavior.
- Integrated the focused compatibility work from community pull request #84 without its duplicate library loaders, replacement zone library, or unrelated formatting changes.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.207.

## Notes

- Intended target client is **WotLK 3.3.5a (12340)**.
- It may work on other versions, but compatibility is not guaranteed.
- `ZygorTalentAdvisor` is bundled and loaded from within `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`.

## Known Issues

- Arrow scale/position drift:
  - On some setups, changing Waypoint Arrow Scale can shift the arrow position unexpectedly.
  - Resetting arrow position may not fully normalize the anchor in all UI/minimap addon combinations.
  - Status: deferred for now.

- Some imported guides may be incomplete or not fully aligned to 3.3.5a data.
- If a guide behaves incorrectly, disable it in `ZygorGuidesViewerRM/Guides/Autoload.xml` and report it.
